- **Cross-Selling and Upselling:** AI can recommend complementary products or higher-value items based on the user’s interests.
- **Dynamic Content:** Personalized recommendations are delivered via dynamic content, such as emails or website banners, providing each customer with a unique experience.

By providing tailored recommendations, businesses can increase customer engagement and encourage more frequent purchases.
